LA-Singular-Value-Decomposition
This project demonstrates the application of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in image compression using Python. By decomposing an image into its singular values and vectors, we can reconstruct approximations of the original image with varying levels of detail, effectively balancing between compression and quality.

Overview
The core of this project is the LA_Proj.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, which includes:

An explanation of SVD and its mathematical foundations.

Loading and preprocessing of the Mona_Lisa_bw_square.jpeg image.

Implementation of SVD on the image matrix.

Reconstruction of the image using a reduced number of singular values.

Visualization of the original and compressed images to illustrate the trade-off between compression and quality.

Usage
Within the notebook, you can:

Understand the theory behind SVD.

Observe how reducing the number of singular values affects image quality.

Experiment with different numbers of singular values to see their impact on compression.

Results
The notebook provides visual comparisons between the original image and its compressed versions using varying numbers of singular values. This illustrates how SVD can effectively compress images while maintaining acceptable quality levels.
