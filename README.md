# LA-Singular-Value-Decomposition

This project demonstrates the application of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in image compression using Python. By decomposing an image into its singular values and vectors, we can reconstruct approximations of the original image with varying levels of detailâ€”balancing compression efficiency and image quality.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The main notebook in this repository, `LA_Proj.ipynb`, includes:

- A brief explanation of SVD and its mathematical foundation.
- Loading and preprocessing of a sample image (`Mona_Lisa_bw_square.jpeg`).
- Application of SVD to the image matrix.
- Reconstruction of the image using a reduced number of singular values.
- Visualization of compression results and quality tradeoffs.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow (PIL)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JAIVAL8/LA-Singular-Value-Decomposition.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd LA-Singular-Value-Decomposition
   ```

3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LA_Proj.ipynb
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

Inside the notebook, you can:

- Learn about how SVD works for image data.
- Experiment with different numbers of singular values to compress the image.
- Visualize the impact of compression on image quality.

## ðŸ“Š Results

The notebook provides side-by-side comparisons of the original image and its compressed versions using fewer singular values, illustrating how information loss and compression ratio are related.
